<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class='statement'>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Symmetric Infinity we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our
<a href='contact.html'>support team</a>.
</p>
<p>
Symmetric Infinity LLC. ("<strong>Symmetric Infinity</strong>") operates several websites including
<a href='http://symmetricinfinity.com/'>SymmetricInfinity.com</a>
and
<a href='index.html'>ZeroPush.com</a>.
It is Symmetric Infinity's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Symmetric Infinity collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Symmetric Infinity's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Symmetric Infinity's visitors use its website. From time to time, Symmetric Infinity may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Symmetric Infinity also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users making authenticated API requests. Symmetric Infinity only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
Certain visitors to Symmetric Infinity's websites choose to interact with Symmetric Infinity in ways that require Symmetric Infinity to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Symmetric Infinity gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a an account at
<a href='index.html'>ZeroPush.com</a>
to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Symmetric Infinity â€“ by purchasing a paid for plan on ZeroPush, for example, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Symmetric Infinity collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Symmetric Infinity. Symmetric Infinity does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Symmetric Infinity may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Symmetric Infinity may monitor the most popular pages on the ZeroPush.com site. Symmetric Infinity may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Symmetric Infinity does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Symmetric Infinity discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Symmetric Infinity's behalf or to provide services available at Symmetric Infinity's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Symmetric Infinity's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Symmetric Infinity will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Symmetric Infinity discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Symmetric Infinity believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Symmetric Infinity, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ZeroPush.com account and have supplied your email address, Symmetric Infinity may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Symmetric Infinity and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Symmetric Infinity takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Symmetric Infinity uses cookies to help Symmetric Infinity identify and track visitors, their usage of Symmetric Infinity website, and their website access preferences. Symmetric Infinity visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Symmetric Infinity's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Symmetric Infinity's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Symmetric Infinity makes use of the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature of Google Analytics to better understand the behavior of our users. Website visitors can use the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Ads Settings</a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">opt-out</a> tools to opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Symmetric Infinity, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Symmetric Infinity goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Symmetric Infinity may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>Notifications and other content sent through the ZeroPush service are not saved long term on our servers unless there were delivery errors, in which case we store them long enough to exhaust our best efforts to deliver them.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Symmetric Infinity may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Symmetric Infinity's sole discretion. Symmetric Infinity encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
