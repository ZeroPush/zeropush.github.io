<h3>The gist</h3>
<p>
We (the
<a href='http://symmetricinfinity.com/'>folks at Symmetric Infinity</a>)
run a push notification service called
<a href='index.html'>ZeroPush.com</a>
and would
<strong>love</strong>
for you to use it. Our basic service is free, and we offer tiered upgrades for advanced features and/or higher API quotas. Our service is designed to give you as much flexibility as possible. However, be responsible in how you use it. In particular, make sure that you follow Apple's guidelines concerning push notification frequency and content.
